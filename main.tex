    \subsection*{Instructions}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select three (3) interpersonal communications skills that you
          worked to improve during this course. Two of the three interpersonal
          communication skills may comprise the ones you practiced and added to
          the Word document each week. At least one should be a skill you feel
          did not improve, or feel you improved less than the others.
        \item Search the internet for video clips (2--5 minutes long)
          illustrating those three skills.
        \item In your written post, list the three skills you selected. For
          each video clip, describe the interaction that is taking place in the
          video clip and identify the interpersonal communication skills that
          are demonstrated. Explain how the people in the clip were using the
          skills, and identify what you can learn from them that might help you
          work on those skills in the future.
        \item Include links to the video clips in your post. Refrain from using
          any video clips that were previously used in the course.
      \end{enumerate}
