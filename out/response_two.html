<p style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The interpersonal communication skills
  that will be discussed are delivery, listening, nonverbal communication and negotiation. I listed delivery and
  listening as my skills to improve upon, and I have improved slightly with delivery and improved more with listening.
  My nonverbal communication is horrible, and my negotiation skills are slightly better.</p>

    style="outline: 0px;">Jack from state Farm commercials are hilarious because things are never what they seem. The
    woman is not listening to her husband when he says who he is talking to on the telephone. Her husband is standing in
    the middle of the darkly lit living room wearing pajamas with his arms folded in front of him. The wife
    doesn&rsquo;t believe her husband because he is whispering or talking lowly, and it&rsquo;s 3 a.m. She then asks the
    person on the telephone questions to validate what her husband says. Her husband doesn&rsquo;t get upset when his
    wife snatches the telephone away from him to talk to the person on the telephone. The husband uses conflict
    resolution to answer the wife&rsquo;s questions quickly, low tone, and non-threatening manner. There&rsquo;s no
    question I would react the same as the woman would except, I would probably throw a pillow or two, nonverbal
    communication and body language, at him while questioning him (State Farm Insurance, 2020).</span></p>

    style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">In this clip, Amy wants Sheldon
    to pass the butter during dinner, but Sheldon only wants Amy to listen to him talk about the evolution of gaming
    systems. Sheldon gets the butter, but he states Amy is not listening. So, she goes along with the conversation, and
    then exclaims about wanting the butter. Sheldon then passed her the butter. Her delivery was harsh but it needed to
    be so he would listen to her request. She was willing to listen to the evolution of gaming systems, but she wanted
    the butter in the meantime. Amy uses effective listening skills before her harsh deliverance of wanting the butter.
    This works well with my son but not so much with adults on a regular basis. A harsh tone is delivered when something
    serious needs attention. For instance, I can use this harsh tone if my son begins to run into the street, and a
    harsh tone will stop him from running into the street. Goal achieved (Lorre and Prady, 2014).</span></p>

    style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Superman negotiated the release
    of Lois Lane to imprison himself to the armed forces of the US. Superman allowed the US armed forces to handcuff him
    to make the armed forces feel secure. Superman did that knowing he would sacrifice something, and, using body
    language, he knew he could break out of the handcuffs anytime which was also shown in the clip. The negotiation was
    a success. In a negotiation, it seems someone has to sacrifice a want for the end goal. I am on a handwashing
    committee in the hospital I work. I identify staff when they do or do not wash their hands, and I enter this
    information into a database. No one likes this. So, I negotiate by stating what I saw, but I can note that the act
    was done after notification. This works for now with staff. I try to enter more acts of handwashing into the
    database, but always point out to the person when it is not done so that the act can eventually happen (Synder,
    2013).</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Eddie Murphy plays Jack, the husband and
  father in this clip, and he uses nonverbal communication to explain to his wife that he will die if he talks. Kerry
  Washington plays Caroline, the wife, continues to talk about what happened when Jack spends time with his character
  son, Tyler, that evening. Even though Jack continues to explain with his hands, arms, face and body what is going on,
  the wife never understands and thinks he is a mental patient then thinks that her talking is killing him. She
  couldn&rsquo;t see past the issue she was discussing to know he was in trouble. Jack tried to used body language to
  show her the new tree in the yard and how that will affect him and the family. Using this example can help me teach a
  sterile procedure to a new nurse. For instance, as the new nurse is assembling a foley catheter for insertion, I can
  use my hands to show her what to do with her hands (Robbins, 2012).</p>
