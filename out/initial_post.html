<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skills I Have Improved On</h4>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skill One: Grasping Psychological Context</h5>
<p class="noindent">Grasping psychological context was originally something at sort of a higher level of difficulty for
  me than many other ideas within the realm of &ldquo;<span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">interpersonal
    communication</span>&rdquo;. More recently, I have done my best to get a thorough read of the environmental aspects
  in addition to the &ldquo;aura&rdquo; &mdash; for lack of a better term &mdash; of the room prior to saying whatever
  was initially on my mind prior to entering the conversation.</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Video Illustrating Skill 1</h5>
<p class="noindent">What follows is a video link illustrating <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">an understanding of
    psychological context</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the previously mentioned video clip, we have two subjects: Finn (the human) and Jake (the dog) of
  Adventure Time. In the clip, we can see how well Jake does at managing the stress of his friend Finn with conquering
  his fear of the ocean (<span class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">leichliter_adventure_2017</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skill Two: Empathy</h5>
<p class="noindent">Empathy is one of the most important aspects, in this author&rsquo;s opinion, in regards to
  interpersonal communication. Empathy, to me, provides the deepest expression of understanding available to the other
  individuals involved in the conversation as the emulation of emotions shows that you are feeling the same pain as the
  speaker is when discussing a situation with them.</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Video Illustration of Empathy</h5>
<p class="noindent">What follows is a video link illustrating <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Empathy</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the previous scene, we see Jake taking the funeral of a peer with an incredibly complex character
  development and strange relationship to our main characters. Finn illustrates empathy when he enters the supply closet
  in an attempt to cheer up his friend Jake. Here, Finn was able to maintain his &ldquo;normal face&rdquo; without
  crying until he empathized with Jake to the extent of losing his grip on his own emotions when seeing Jake cry (<span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>The One I am Still Working On</h4>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Listening with The Intent to Understand, Not Reply</h5>
<p class="noindent">Listening with the intent to understand, rather than with the intent to respond, is an incredibly
  important skill I had felt I lacked in my interpersonal communication skill chest for a significant part of my
  adolescent and adult life. Before I was conscience of this fact, I would immediately relate what someone was telling
  me is happening in their life to myself or how my experience could help them understand or get through their own.
  Unfortunately, I still have this habit (as do my peers I shared this assignment with who also feel this skill is <span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">incredibly </span>difficult to master).</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Video Illustrating Skill 3</h5>
<p class="noindent">What follows is a video link illustrating <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">listening with the intent to
    understand, rather than with the </span><span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">intent to respond</span>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk_M0-3qaVQ?start=62&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0"

<p class="noindent">In the previous scene we see Finn speaking with Princess Bubblegum about her concerns with him
  dating another princess on the planet, named Flame Princess. Finn did not listen well enough to understand that it is
  not that Princess Bubblegum is romantically interested in him being the reason he cannot see her, but rather that
  &ldquo;love&rdquo; would cause some sort of reaction too dangerous for them to handle (<span
