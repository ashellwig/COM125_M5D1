<p>The first thing I've begun to work on in my communication is clarity in speech. In this movie clip it shows Ace
  Ventura speaking very quickly while keeping his speech clear. It shows multiple scenes where he takes a deep breath
  and quickly answers their questions fully while not stuttering or making a mistake. He stays confident in his tone.
  One thing I can learn from this is to remember to take a deep breath. This helps you to stay calm so that you can stay
  clear in your speech.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/_Q8ogINyP_U" target="_blank">Clip 1</a></p>
<p>Another thing I have been working on is managing emotions in speech. In this video clip Peter goes through a couple
  of things that for a lot of people would have caused an emotional outbreak. For one, he was talked to by both bosses
  when neither of them seemed to listen to him, and another coworker was playing the radio which seemed to annoy Peter.
  With all of these things, Peter could have reacted with anger or frustration. Instead, he stayed calm and moved on. He
  didn't allow the things to bother him too much and moved on which is something I could learn to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/jsLUidiYm0w" target="_blank">Clip 2</a></p>
<p>The final thing I could have worked more on was nonverbal communication skills. This was something I didn't focus
  enough on. In the first scene of this clip, Lucy struggles with her nonverbal communication skills but after each try
  gets a little better. She's working on her facial expressions and by smiling is able to conceal her emotions a little.
  Something I learned from this is it can be difficult sometimes, but it helps to try and smile through it.&nbsp;</p>
