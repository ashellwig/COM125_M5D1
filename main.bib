Adventure Time is about two close friends: Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. These two dudes are all they have in the ways of family. They depend and lean on each other through thick and thin, they trust one another with secrets and look to each other for advice when problems get out of hand. More important than any of that, Finn and Jake crack each other up by acting like idiots and telling ridiculous jokes as they traverse their way across a massive and treacherous island seeking heart­ pounding adventure to pass the time.

At first glance you probably wouldn't know it, but Finn is a mighty hero. It's true, he's passionate about heroism. For a twelve-year-old kid, saving princesses and battling sinister wizards, it's quite an admirable hobby. Finn doesn't know why he's compelled to protect good from evil; it's just something he understands is necessary. It could be in his blood, maybe his parents were noble do gooders like him. Maybe they're royal cosmic cowboys fighting intergalactic outlaws in space, maybe they're the presidents of righteous Dinosaur Knights. Finn doesn't know his own mysterious origin. Even though he doesn't have the skills to win the battle, Finn is a furious little booger when it comes to opposing evil. Finn isn't very muscley, he's kinda small with a big fat head and little feet. What Finn does have is a strong moral backbone, a clear set of values and a lot of nerve! That's what makes him a hero. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Throwing caution to the wind in order to protect the ones he loves. Finn takes pleasure in all the standard kid business like making up songs and crashing monster dance parties. And when evil isn't running amok? Finn is happy to spend those carefree moments jumping on rocks, rolling around in the grass or exploring his favorite adventure spots.

Jake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say.
 
Come on get ready to travel to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end. It’s adventure time!
