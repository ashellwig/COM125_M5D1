    The interpersonal communication skills that will be discussed are delivery,
      listening, nonverbal communication and negotiation. I listed delivery and
      listening as my skills to improve upon, and I have improved slightly with
      delivery and improved more with listening. My nonverbal communication is
      horrible, and my negotiation skills are slightly better.

    Jack from state Farm commercials are hilarious because things are never
      what they seem. The woman is not listening to her husband when he says
      who he is talking to on the telephone. Her husband is standing in the
      middle of the darkly lit living room wearing pajamas with his arms folded
      in front of him. The wife doesn’t believe her husband because he is
      whispering or talking lowly, and it’s 3 a.m. She then asks the person on
      the telephone questions to validate what her husband says. Her husband
      doesn't get upset when his wife snatches the telephone away from him to
      talk to the person on the telephone. The husband uses conflict resolution
      to answer the wife's questions quickly, low tone, and non-threatening
      manner. There's no question I would react the same as the woman would
      except, I would probably throw a pillow or two, nonverbal communication
      and body language, at him while questioning him
      (State Farm Insurance, 2020).
